# JFrog Credential Provider Helm Chart - Changelog

All notable changes to this Helm chart will be documented in this file.

## [1.4.0] - 16th June, 2026
* Added support for `imds_direct` auth flow for Azure to get rid of the federated credentials limit
* Updated projected token flow for Azure to work without app registration
* Added `azure.jfrog_token_audience` to control the audience requested during the Artifactory OIDC token exchange (defaults to `*@*`)
* The Azure Artifactory token-exchange audience now defaults to `*@*` instead of the Azure app client id. If your Artifactory OIDC identity mapping uses a non-wildcard `token_spec.audience`, set `azure.jfrog_token_audience` to that value.

## [1.3.0] - 11th June, 2026
* Native OpenShift Support (`platform: openshift`): Added built-in support for AWS (`ROSA`) and Azure (`ARO`) that automatically merges your custom settings into the platform’s existing cloud credential files (`ecr-credential-provider.yaml` or `acr-credential-provider.yaml`).
* Smart Binary Installation Workaround: Implemented an automated installer that safely saves the plugin binary into a writable folder (`/var/lib/...`) and tricks OpenShift's locked-down, read-only system into seeing it exactly where the node expects it (`/usr/libexec/...`).
* Enhanced Workload Security (`OpenShift 4.21+`): Integrated secure token exchanges (tokenAttributes) to let individual application accounts securely pull images.
* Added [OpenShift.md](../OpenShift.md) (consolidates ROSA.md and ARO.md)
* Added [examples/openshift-azure-projected-sa-values.yaml](../examples/openshift-azure-projected-sa-values.yaml) and [examples/openshift-aws-projected-sa-values.yaml](../examples/openshift-aws-projected-sa-values.yaml)

**Note: The JFrog credential provider is supported on OpenShift versions 4.21 and above.
