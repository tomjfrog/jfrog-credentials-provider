# 🐸 JFrog Kubelet Credential Provider

A [Kubernetes kubelet credential provider](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubelet-credential-provider/) **for Amazon EKS, Azure AKS, Google GKE, and Red Hat OpenShift (on AWS and Azure)** that enables seamless, passwordless authentication with JFrog Artifactory for container image pulls, eliminating the need for manual image pull secret management.

## 📋 Overview

The JFrog Kubelet Credential Provider leverages the native Kubernetes kubelet Credential Provider feature (the same standard used by Amazon ECR, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure for their native registry authentication) to dynamically retrieve credentials for pulling container images from JFrog Artifactory. Instead of using long-lived, static passwords or API keys, this solution uses temporary, identity-based credentials that are dynamically generated on-demand.

This approach provides several benefits:

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🔐 **No Image Pull Secrets** | Eliminates the need to create and manage Kubernetes secrets across namespaces |
| 🛡️ **Enhanced Security** | Credentials are retrieved dynamically rather than stored in etcd, minimizing attack surface |
| 🔑 **Passwordless Authentication** | Uses cloud provider identity (IAM roles, managed identities, service accounts) instead of static credentials |
| ⚡ **Simplified Operations** | Reduces operational overhead for credential rotation and management |
| 🔗 **Native Integration** | Uses built-in Kubernetes capabilities for credential management |
| ⏱️ **Short-Lived Tokens** | Artifactory returns newly generated, short-lived tokens for registry authentication |

## 🎯 Strategic Benefits

### 🛡️ Enhanced Security Posture (Identity over Secrets)

The security posture of Kubernetes deployments is dramatically enhanced by moving away from long-lived passwords and static API keys. The replacement of these persistent credentials with short-lived and dynamically generated tokens minimizes the attack surface and the potential blast radius in the event of a cluster compromise. The solution enforces the principle of least privilege by linking image pull access directly to the validated infrastructure identity of the worker node (its IAM role, managed identity, or service account). By embedding the cryptographic proof of identity within the artifact pull process, the risk of external or internal credential theft is effectively neutralized.

### ⚡ Operational Efficiency and Speed of Deployment

Operators are liberated from the continuous, tedious, and often error-prone tasks associated with managing Kubernetes secrets, rotation schedules, and ensuring correct namespace-specific configurations. This elimination of secret management reduces operational friction, ensuring greater stability and allowing for significantly faster workload deployments. This efficiency is especially critical for large organizations who need to rapidly deploy new workloads without inheriting the complexity and security issues that were previously unavoidable.

### ✨ Optimized User Experience

By streamlining the use of JFrog Artifactory with Kubernetes, the integration offers an overall optimized user experience and delivers greater stability throughout the deployment pipeline. Developers and DevOps teams can focus on application delivery rather than infrastructure credential plumbing, trusting that the underlying infrastructure identity mechanisms will securely and automatically handle artifact authentication.

## ⚠️ The Problem with Traditional Credential Management

The current deployment model for applications hosted in private registries relies on including `imagePullSecrets` within deployment configurations. These secrets typically hold long-lived authentication artifacts, like passwords, API keys, or access tokens, required to authenticate against the private registry. While functional, this traditional method introduces significant security vulnerabilities and operational overhead:

<details>
<summary><strong>🚨 Security Risks</strong></summary>

- **Static Secrets in etcd**: Passwords sit as static secrets in your Kubernetes etcd database, creating an unnecessary attack surface
- **Long-Lived Credentials**: Persistent credentials increase the potential blast radius in the event of a cluster compromise
- **Credential Exposure**: Secrets are visible to users with namespace access and can be exposed through logs or config dumps

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>😫 Operational Headaches</strong></summary>

- **Multi-Namespace Management**: You often need one secret per namespace across a large cluster
- **Manual Rotation**: If an access token is revoked or expires, you must manually update secrets across all relevant namespaces
- **Complex CI/CD Logic**: Requires substantial resources and complex automation just for secret rotation
- **Deployment Friction**: Every new workload must be configured with the correct `imagePullSecrets` reference

</details>

## 🔄 How It Works: Identity Over Passwords

The JFrog Kubelet Credential Provider implements a **passwordless credential flow** that uses your cloud provider's identity system instead of static secrets. This solution is based on the established, built-in Kubernetes feature called the **Kubelet Image Credential Provider** - the same standard used by Amazon ECR, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure for their native registry authentication.

**🔐 The Passwordless Credential Flow:**

```

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **📦 Image Pull Request**: A new pod needs an image from Artifactory
2. **🎯 Kubelet Interception**: The Kubelet on your worker node matches the image host with the pattern configured for the JFrog provider
3. **⚙️ Plugin Execution**: The Kubelet executes the configured plugin binary: `jfrog-credential-provider`
4. **🔄 Token Exchange**: The provider uses the worker node's verified cloud identity (AWS IAM Role/OIDC or Azure managed identity) and exchanges that proof of identity with Artifactory via OIDC
5. **🎫 Short-Lived Token**: Artifactory returns a newly generated, short-lived token intended for registry authentication
6. **✅ Image Pull**: The Kubelet uses the temporary token to securely pull the image and complete the deployment

> **💡 Key Point**: No Kubernetes secret creation or management is required. Credentials are dynamically generated on the node and cached inside the kubelet process memory, never stored in etcd.

</div>

## 📥 Provider Binary Source

By default, the init container downloads the `jfrog-credential-provider` binary at deploy time from the public JFrog releases URL (`downloadUrl`) with **anonymous access**. The chart automatically appends the node's architecture suffix (`-amd64` / `-arm64`).

You can change where and how the binary is acquired using two cloud-agnostic settings.

### 🌐 Option A: Download from a custom URL (default mechanism)

Override `downloadUrl` to pull the binary from your own location (for example, a binary mirrored into your own Artifactory generic repository):

```yaml
downloadUrl: "https://your-org.jfrog.io/artifactory/your-repo/jfrog-credential-provider/1.2.0/jfrog-credential-provider-linux"
```

> **⚠️ Best practice — hosting the binary yourself:**
> If you change the default `downloadUrl` to serve the binary from your own Artifactory, it is **strongly preferred to host it in a dedicated repository with anonymous (unauthenticated) read access enabled**. The binary is a public, non-sensitive artifact, and keeping it on an anonymous repo avoids distributing download credentials to every node.
>
> If your organization has a **hard requirement** that the repository must be private (no anonymous access), then secure it with download credentials (see Option C) and follow the principle of least privilege:
> - Create a **dedicated, least-privileged user** (or token) that has **read-only access to that one repository only** — never an admin or broadly-scoped account.
> - Do not reuse existing credentials that have access to other repositories or platform features.
> - Rotate the credential periodically.

### 📦 Option B: Use a pre-baked / air-gapped binary (`internalBinaryHostPath`)

For air-gapped clusters or AMI-baked nodes, set `internalBinaryHostPath` to the absolute path of the binary already present on the node. When set, the download step is **skipped entirely**, so no `downloadUrl` and no credentials are needed.

```yaml
# Skips the download; copies the binary from this host path instead.
# The binary must match the node architecture (no automatic -amd64/-arm64 suffixing here).
internalBinaryHostPath: "/opt/jfrog-cp/jfrog-credential-provider-linux-amd64"
```

> **💡 Tip:** This is the most secure and most reliable option for locked-down/air-gapped environments since nothing is fetched over the network at deploy time.

### 🔐 Option C: Authenticated download from a private repository (`binaryDownload.auth`)

If the binary must be downloaded from a **private** Artifactory repository, supply download credentials via `binaryDownload.auth`. Use **either** an existing Secret, **or** inline credentials (which the chart turns into a Secret for you). Use `username` + `password` **or** `accessToken` alone — not both.

```yaml
binaryDownload:
  auth:
    # Reference a pre-created Secret (keys: username, password, accessToken)
    existingSecret: "jfrog-binary-download-creds"

    # --- OR --- provide inline credentials (chart creates the Secret)
    # accessToken: "<least-privileged-token>"
    # username: "jfrog-cp-binary-reader"
    # password: "<password>"
```

> **🛡️ Security reminder:** As noted above, prefer an **anonymous dedicated repo** over authenticated downloads. Only use `binaryDownload.auth` when a private repo is a hard requirement, and always back it with a **least-privileged, repository-scoped read-only** user or token. Prefer a scoped `accessToken` over a username/password, and prefer `existingSecret` (managed by your secrets tooling) over inline values.

See [`helm/values.yaml`](./helm/values.yaml) for the full field-level reference.
